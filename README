VERSION

SYNOPSIS
        package MyClass;
        use Moose;
        has stash => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'HashRef', traits => [qw(MergeHashRef)] );

        my $class = MyClass->new;
        $class->stash({ animals => { dogs => 1 } });
        # $class->stash: { animals => { dogs => 1 } }
        $class->stash({ animals => { cats => 2 } });
        # $class->stash: { animals => { dogs => 1, cats => 2 } }
        $class->set_stash({ foo => bar });

        $class->clear_stash;
        # $class->stash: undef

DESCRIPTION
    This trait will merge values added to a HashRef attribute. It uses
    Hash::Merge to combine them. The method "set_$attr" which resets the
    attribute with a given hashref is also created. Call "clear_$attr" to
    clear the attribute.
